Skyrim belongs to the Gourds!
Requested by Reddit user aswd2471 in this thread.

I first saw it on /r/skyrimmods here.

Seemed like a reasonable enough request, so I knocked it out in about an hour, then spent a couple more hours figuring out skinning/rigging, plus a bit more for testing. Call it 3 hours? Plus this is the first time I've ever rigged a mesh! Only two bones, but hey, first time!

How to Use

Just pick the Gourd race from the Race menu. You can also use "SetRace vSBG_GourdRace", but that will leave a deformed version of the character's head floating over the Gourd in a rather grotesque manner.

Compatibility

Completely untested with anything other than vanilla Skyrim. *Probably* works with most things, since it's skinned on an unaltered character skeleton.

The Gourd is skinned to the NPC Pelvis [Pelvis] and NPC Head [Head] bones, so sliders for those nodes will probably work in RaceMenu. Come to think of it, that probably means this mod will work with [BobbleHeads](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65248/).
