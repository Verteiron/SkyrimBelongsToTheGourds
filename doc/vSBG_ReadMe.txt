Skyrim belongs to the Gourds!

Requested by Reddit user aswd2471.

Seemed like a reasonable enough request, so I knocked it out in about an hour, then spent a couple more hours figuring out skinning/rigging, plus a bit more for testing. Call it 3 hours? Plus this is the first time I've ever rigged a mesh! Only two bones, but hey, first time!

Version 1.1.1: CONSOLES BELONG TO THE GOURDS!

Gourds have annexed the XBox console, because the PC wasn't big enough for them.
They eyed the PS4 longingly, but Sony says no. Too bad.

Version 1.1.0: Gourds with Legs

You can now choose the classic (day-old) Gourd race, or the all-new Gourd with Legs race, bringing a whole new level of horror to daily life in the land of Skyrim.

How to Use

Just pick the Gourd race from the Race menu. You can also use "SetRace vSBG_GourdRace", but that will leave a deformed version of the character's head floating over the Gourd in a rather grotesque manner.

Compatibility

Completely untested with anything other than vanilla Skyrim. *Probably* works with most things, since it's skinned on an unaltered character skeleton.

The Gourd is skinned to the NPC Pelvis [Pelvis] and NPC Head [Head] bones, so sliders for those nodes will probably work in RaceMenu. Come to think of it, that probably means this mod will work with [BobbleHeads](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65248/).

FAQ

Q. Shields?
A. It's complicated. Here's the short version:

* Shields are considered Armor.
* Skyrim strictly regulates what Armor can be used by what Races (remember that many Skyrim races are non-humanoid monsters). If you create a new Race, you either have to... 
    1. Add that Race to every existing Armor piece (which, with mods, is functionally impossible) *or* 
    2. Have the new Race copy its list of allowed Armor from another Race (which is what most people do).
* If I copy the Gourd race's Armor list from another Race, like NordRace, then *all* Armors become equippable. This means that your Gourd will have a shield, but will also have a helmet, distorted floating guantlets, boots, and in general look less like a Gourd than like a horrible glitch.

So with all that in mind, I am not supporting Gourds with Shields at the moment. If there is enough demand I suppose I could make a seperate Race that allowed Armor and let people just equip the pieces they want. OR I could use a script that shrinks down all armor nodes except Shield down to invisibility, but the whole point of this mod was to keep it as simple as possible :P

Q. Why?
A. Because.
