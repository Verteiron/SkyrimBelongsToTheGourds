# SkyrimBelongsToTheGourds
Skyrim belongs to the Gourds!

Requested by Reddit user aswd2471 in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/48mi6a/is_there_a_mod_that_adds_gourds_as_a_playable_race/).

I first saw it on /r/skyrimmods [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/48o738/so_rskyrim_wants_to_play_as_a_gourd_can_someone/).

Seemed like a reasonable enough request, so I knocked it out in an hour. Plus this is the first time I've ever rigged a model! Only two bones, but hey, first time!
