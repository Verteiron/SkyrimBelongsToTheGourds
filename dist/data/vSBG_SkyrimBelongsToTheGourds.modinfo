	"Description" : "Skyrim belongs to the Gourds!\r\n\r\nRequested by Reddit user aswd2471.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1.1: CONSOLES BELONG TO THE GOURDS!\r\n\r\nGourds have annexed the XBox and PS4 consoles, because the PC wasn't big enough for them.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.1.0: Gourds with Legs\r\n\r\nYou can now choose the classic (day-old) Gourd race, or the all-new Gourd with Legs race, bringing a whole new level of horror to daily life in the land of Skyrim.\r\n\r\nHow to Use\r\n\r\nJust pick the Gourd race from the Race menu. You can also use \"SetRace vSBG_GourdRace\", but that will leave a deformed version of the character's head floating over the Gourd in a rather grotesque manner.\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\nCompletely untested with anything other than vanilla Skyrim. *Probably* works with most things, since it's skinned on an unaltered character skeleton.\r\n\r\nFAQ\r\n\r\nQ. Shields?\r\nA. It's complicated. Here's the short version:\r\n\r\n* Shields are considered Armor.\r\n* Skyrim strictly regulates what Armor can be used by what Races (remember that many Skyrim races are non-humanoid monsters). If you create a new Race, you either have to... \r\n    1. Add that Race to every existing Armor piece (which, with mods, is functionally impossible) *or* \r\n    2. Have the new Race copy its list of allowed Armor from another Race (which is what most people do).\r\n* If I copy the Gourd race's Armor list from another Race, like NordRace, then *all* Armors become equippable. This means that your Gourd will have a shield, but will also have a helmet, distorted floating guantlets, boots, and in general look less like a Gourd than like a horrible glitch.\r\n\r\nSo with all that in mind, I am not supporting Gourds with Shields at the moment. If there is enough demand I suppose I could make a seperate Race that allowed Armor and let people just equip the pieces they want. OR I could use a script that shrinks down all armor nodes except Shield down to invisibility, but the whole point of this mod was to keep it as simple a",
